# The Boys Thrive Foundation — Website

A static, multi-page website for **The Boys Thrive Foundation**, a non-profit
organisation supporting the mental health, emotional resilience, and social
development of boys and young men aged 12–25, particularly in
under-resourced communities.

> "Speak Up. Grow Strong. Thrive Together."

## BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Many young boys struggle with mental and emotional challenges but do not receive enough support. Society can sometimes teach boys that they should not show emotions or ask for help. As a result, some boys keep their problems to themselves and may turn to unhealthy behaviours such as substance abuse, violence or isolation. There is therefore a need for an organisation that provides boys with emotional support, mentorship and life skills.

1. Provide Mental Health Information
2. Encourage Boys to Talk About Their Feelings
3. Provide Access to Support
5. Promote Mentorship Programmes
6. Advertise Events and Activities
7. Provide Educational Resources
8. Recruit Volunteers and Mentors
9. Increase Awareness of the NGO
10. Encourage Donations and Partnerships
11. Create a Safe and Accessible Online Platform
12. Improve Communication

## Pages

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Landing page with a hero banner, three highlight cards (Resources, Mentorship, Community Events), and a 24/7 crisis helpline banner. |
| `About.html` | Describes the foundation's mission, vision, and the issues young men face. |
| `resources.html` | A grid of articles (stress, bullying, anger management, study tips, careers, self-esteem) plus an FAQ. |
| `get-support.html` | A form for visitors to request mentorship, group sessions, or counseling referrals. |
| `gallery.html` | A filterable image gallery of past events (mentorship, workshops, sports days). |
| `contact.html` | Contact details, an embedded map, banking details for donations, and a volunteer/mentor application form. |

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic markup, one file per page
- **CSS3** — custom properties (CSS variables), Flexbox, CSS Grid, responsive media queries

 The site runs entirely in the browser.

## Design System

Colors and spacing are defined as CSS custom properties for consistency:

| Variable | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--primary-color` | `#1a365d` | Header, footer, headings |
| `--secondary-color` | `#2b6cb0` | Page headers, links |
| `--accent-color` | `#319795` | Highlights, buttons, hover states |
| `--light-bg` | `#f7fafc` | Page background |
| `--dark-text` | `#2d3748` | Body text |

The layout is responsive, with a breakpoint at `768px` that stacks the
navigation and hero content for mobile devices.

## Notes & Known Limitations

- **Duplicated styles:** Each HTML page currently includes its own `<style>`
  block in the `<head>`, and `Style.css` contains the same rules consolidated
  into one file. The pages do not yet link to `Style.css` via
  `<link rel="stylesheet">` — doing so and removing the inline `<style>`
  blocks would reduce duplication and make future styling changes easier.
- **Forms are front-end only:** The "Get Support," "Contact & Join," and
  volunteer/mentor forms use `action="#"` with a JavaScript `alert()` on
  submit. No data is actually sent or stored — a backend endpoint (or a
  form service) is needed before these forms are functional in production.
- **Filter buttons are static:** The category filter buttons on
  `gallery.html` are not yet wired up with JavaScript to actually filter
  the displayed images.
- **External images:** Gallery and hero images are pulled from Unsplash via
  hotlinked URLs; consider hosting images locally for production reliability.
- **File naming:** `About.html` uses a capitalized filename, while
  navigation links elsewhere reference `about.html` (lowercase) — file
  systems that are case-sensitive (e.g. most Linux-based web servers) will
  break this link unless it's renamed for consistency.
